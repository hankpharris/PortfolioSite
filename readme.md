Hello! 
This is a portfolio project meant to store and log all of my personal projects.
Its built using Next.JS and PostgreSQL and is deployed with vercel.
Its centered around a projects page which contains a list of all of my projects with neat cards for each. Each project is stored in the database and the project is structured to autogenerate pages and cards whenever I upload new project details through the database.
It also contains a contact me popup using resend, an OAuth based login and auth system (through git), an ai chatbot built with OpenAi's gpt 4o-mini, and an admin panel (just for me) which allows for convenient and simple modification of the database.
